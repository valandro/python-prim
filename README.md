# PRIM Algorithm

In computer science, `Prim's` (also known as Jarník's) algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a `minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph`. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.

### Running

```
python src/prim.py examples/graph1.wug
```

### Weighted Undirected Graph
Example:

**Graph 1**
